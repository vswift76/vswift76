- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Virginia Swift aka @vswift76 aka Sevdawn on Twitch/Twitter/IG aka Lady Gin Swift, Bard of the Freakshow
      (the latter is a title I gave myself as a follower of the Swedish metal band Avatar, as I dress up as Avatar's vocalist for 
       shows and most of my concert photos are of this amazing band)  I am a wife, mom of two sons and two cats, Sagitarian, dragon,
      cosplayer, sometime Twitch streamer, causal gamer, and so much more. 
       
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things computers. I know my way around software/hardware installations, in my home life I have 
      swapped out hard drives, memory sticks, video cards, and power supplies on our desktops. On the side, I am a Twitch affilate and sometimes 
      stream playing computer games. I also stream once a year as part of a group called the Goo Metal Meal Meltdown, we
      do cooking streams to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Last year, my husband and I raised 
      $2000 for the kids of St. Jude! I also do concert photography as a hobby, I say all of the time I'm not a pro, just a fan with a smartphone. 
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript through Code Louisville. I have also taken two courses on front end web development.
      In the past I have hosted websites on sites like GoDaddy, so I do know the basics of hosting and updating sites.
